    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone elseâ€™s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",

To clarify, $\\log(L)$ is the composition of $\\log$ and $L$: $\\log(L)$ at $p$ is $\\log(L(p))$. Even though it doesn't make a difference for this problem, $\\log$ is now and forevermore the $\\log$ to the base $e$, not to the base 10.\n",
